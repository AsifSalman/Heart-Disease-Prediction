# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This repository will predict the heart disease patients by using Mechine Learning tools.
# What the project is about?
The objective of this project is to apply the Supervised Learning: Decision Tree in the Heart Disease Dataset.
<br> The dataset is collected from __UCI Machine learning Repository__.
# Codes
1. Deal with the missing values
2. Perform One-hot Encoding
3. Split the dataset into 80% training and 20% for testing. Add random state and stratification
4. Perform the training with Decision Tree Classifier
5. Show a tree diagram of the Decision Tree
6. Show the Confusion Matrix, Classification report, and ROC-AUC.
